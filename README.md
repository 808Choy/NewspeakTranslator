**Newspeak Translator**

An assignment for my English class, this program translates between Oldspeak and Newspeak (the fictional language introduced in George Orwell's novel *1984*). `Translate.py` contains the translation engine and a simple prompt. The other python files were an attempt at a Curses based GUI and a network protocol for chatroom-based translation, however those are incomplete due to time constraints.  

**To run**

 `python Translate.py` will run the translation engine with a simple prompt.
